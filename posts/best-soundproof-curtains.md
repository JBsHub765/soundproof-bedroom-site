# Best Soundproof Curtains for a Quiet Bedroom

A busy street or rowdy neighbours can turn your bedroom into a restless zone.  **Soundproof curtains** are designed to absorb and muffle noise so you can sleep, work or relax in peace.  Unlike regular drapes, good noise‑reducing curtains have multiple heavy layers, often with blackout fabric, to block light and dampen sound.  They are typically heavier than standard curtains and sometimes use a triple‑weave or felted lining.  According to independent testing, soundproof curtains help reduce noise intrusion by absorbing and muffling sound and are often designed as blackout curtains to offer privacy and keep light out【875460514847969†L133-L137】.

If your noise problem is severe, you might also need structural improvements such as wall or window treatments.

## Key takeaways

- Soundproof curtains absorb and dampen noise rather than completely blocking it; heavier, multilayer fabrics do a better job【695154032832323†L189-L214】.
- Size matters: choose curtains at least **2.5–3.5× the width** of your window and **8.5–11.5 inches longer** than the window height for effective coverage【695154032832323†L170-L185】.
- Look for high‑density materials such as velvet, microfiber and triple‑weave polyester; additional liners or felt interlayers improve performance【695154032832323†L243-L260】.
- Wrap‑around rods that curve towards the wall minimise gaps around the edges and maximise surface area【695154032832323†L215-L238】.
- Check for features like **100 % blackout**, noise‑reduction ratings, thermal insulation, fade resistance and good return policies【695154032832323†L271-L283】.

## Buyer’s guide: how to choose noise‑reducing curtains

When shopping for soundproof curtains, pay close attention to the following criteria.  Using the right combination will make a noticeable difference in how much noise the curtains absorb.

### Size and coverage

Curtains that barely cover the window will not absorb much sound.  Experts recommend choosing curtains **2.5 to 3.5 times wider** than the window and **8.5 to 11.5 inches longer**【695154032832323†L170-L185】.  The extra width creates generous folds and increases the surface area that absorbs sound.  Some people mount curtains from the ceiling to the floor to maximise coverage【695154032832323†L170-L185】.

### Weight and layers

Soundproof curtains work by adding mass.  Heavier fabrics have higher density and are better at absorbing low‑frequency noise such as machinery or traffic【695154032832323†L189-L204】.  In fact, tripling the layers or folding lighter curtains can significantly improve their performance【695154032832323†L209-L214】.  If you live near industrial areas, heavy curtains may be worth the extra cost【695154032832323†L189-L204】.

### Mounting hardware

The curtain rod matters more than you might think.  A **wrap‑around rod** with curved ends keeps the fabric flush against the wall, eliminating gaps that let sound leak through.  This design maximises the curtain’s surface area and increases noise absorption【695154032832323†L215-L238】.  Make sure the rod is strong enough to hold the extra weight of soundproof curtains【695154032832323†L215-L238】.

### Materials and liners

High‑fiber fabrics like **velvet**, **microfiber** and **thermal‑insulated polyester** absorb sound better than thin cotton or linen【695154032832323†L243-L260】.  Look for terms like *triple weave*, *microfiber* and *thermal* in the product description.  Curtains with an **extra liner** (e.g., felt or mass‑loaded vinyl) sandwiched between layers provide superior noise damping【695154032832323†L243-L260】【695154032832323†L325-L329】.  A blackout liner also helps block light and UV rays.

### Extra features

Consider these secondary factors when comparing products:

- **Blackout rating:** A 100 % blackout liner not only blocks light but can also enhance sound absorption【695154032832323†L271-L279】.
- **Thermal insulation:** Some curtains are labelled “energy smart” because they help retain warmth in winter and keep rooms cooler in summer【695154032832323†L271-L279】.
- **Fade resistance:** Quality curtains are treated to resist fading, protecting your furniture and décor from UV exposure【695154032832323†L280-L281】.
- **Return policy and warranty:** A good return policy or warranty provides peace of mind if the curtains don’t meet your expectations【695154032832323†L282-L283】.

### Pony Dance Blackout Insulated Soundproof Curtains (Runner‑up)

The Pony Dance curtains stood out in independent testing.

They come in numerous colours and sizes and can be hung via rod pockets or tabs, making them versatile for different window types【875460514847969†L235-L249】.  However, the fabric tends to hold wrinkles, so steaming may be needed after washing【875460514847969†L235-L251】.

During testing, they reduced noise by around **5 decibels**【875460514847969†L265-L294】.  Note that they aren’t fully blackout due to their lighter weight【875460514847969†L270-L295】.

## Alternatives & FAQs

### Are soundproof curtains effective?

Soundproof curtains don’t make a room completely silent.  Instead, they absorb echoes and dampen incoming noise.  Their effectiveness depends on the curtain’s weight, material and installation.  For maximum reduction, use heavy, multilayer curtains with a wrap‑around rod and ensure they cover the entire window.

### Do soundproof curtains help with temperature control?

Yes.  Many noise‑reducing curtains also have thermal insulation, which helps retain heat in winter and keep rooms cooler in summer【695154032832323†L271-L279】.  This energy‑smart feature can even reduce your heating or cooling bills.

### How do I clean noise‑reducing curtains?

Most soundproof curtains, including NICETOWN and BGment, are machine washable on a gentle cycle.  Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.  Some fabrics may wrinkle after washing and require steaming【875460514847969†L235-L251】.

### Can curtains replace other soundproofing methods?

Curtains are best used as part of a layered approach.  They reduce echoes and some mid‑to‑high frequency noise but won’t block all outside noise.  For more demanding situations, pair curtains with window inserts, acoustic panels or structural modifications such as adding mass‑loaded vinyl【695154032832323†L325-L329】.
