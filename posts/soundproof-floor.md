title: "Soundproof Floor: How to Reduce Noise Through Flooring"

Noise travelling through floors can be particularly frustrating in apartments or multistorey homes. The best floor soundproofing strategies combine mass, absorption and isolation. Start by adding a thick carpet with a dense underlay; the underlay sits between the carpet and subfloor, blocking airborne sound and cushioning impact noise【818429391658882†L246-L263】. Materials like recycled rubber underlay offer high acoustic performance and are eco-friendly【818429391658882†L246-L263】.

If your floor is hard (wood or tile), lay mass-loaded vinyl (MLV) beneath a new floating floor or under your existing carpet. MLV is a dense yet flexible material made from vinyl and mineral fillers; its heavy mass resists vibrations and blocks airborne noise【494679951678928†L112-L141】. Choose rolls with a weight of 1 lb or 2 lbs per square foot depending on the level of soundproofing required【494679951678928†L112-L141】. Install it wall to wall and seal seams with vinyl tape to prevent leaks.

Decoupling is another effective technique. When constructing a new floor or renovating, use resilient channels or isolation clips to separate the ceiling joists from the floor above and create a flexible barrier【363269732506425†L35-L68】. This breaks the direct path for sound and reduces vibrations passing through the structure【363269732506425†L82-L107】. Combine decoupling with a double layer of gypsum board and acoustic caulk at the seams to maximise performance.

### Final Thoughts

For the best results, use a combination of methods: install a dense underlay under a plush carpet, add a layer of MLV, and, where possible, decouple structural elements during renovations. These steps together provide a significant reduction in both airborne and impact noise through your floors.
