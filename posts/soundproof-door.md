# How to Soundproof a Door: Seal Gaps and Reduce Noise

Doors are one of the weakest points in any soundproofing project. Even when walls are solid, noise sneaks through gaps around and under a door or vibrates right through a flimsy hollow‑core panel. Because bedroom, office and apartment doors are designed to be lightweight and affordable, they often have little mass and poor seals【667730347589269†L245-L257】. Fortunately, upgrading a door is one of the quickest ways to reduce noise transmission. This guide walks you through practical methods to make any door quieter.

## Seal gaps with weatherstripping and sweeps

The first step is to stop sound from leaking around the edges. Light shining through a closed door is a clear sign that noise can pass through. Install self‑adhesive foam or rubber weatherstripping along the sides and top of the door frame. Choose high‑density neoprene or silicon strips designed for acoustic sealing. For the bottom gap, fit a door sweep or automatic drop seal. A simple sweep screws onto the bottom of the door and has a rubber blade that drags along the floor, while an automatic drop seal lowers a gasket when the door closes but lifts when you open it.

Use acoustic caulk to seal any cracks between the frame and wall【667730347589269†L265-L272】. Check the threshold; if there’s a gap between the floor and the door frame, install a threshold seal or use a draft excluder. These low‑cost products drastically reduce the amount of noise passing around the door.

## Increase the door’s mass

Thin, hollow‑core doors provide almost no barrier to sound. If you’re able to replace the door, choose a solid‑core model. Solid‑core doors are made from dense engineered wood or composite materials and have much better acoustic performance. If replacement isn’t an option, add mass by mounting mass‑loaded vinyl or acoustic panels directly to the door. Cut the material to size, adhere it to the door’s surface and cover it with a layer of plywood or a decorative finish.

Another simple solution is to hang a soundproofing blanket or moving quilt on the door. These heavy blankets contain dense cotton and polyester fibres that absorb sound. Attach them with hooks or velcro so they can be removed when you need full use of the door.

## Upgrade hinges and latches

A poorly fitting door can rattle and leave uneven gaps. Ensure the door hangs square in the frame by tightening or replacing hinges. If the latch doesn’t pull the door snugly against the frame, adjust the strike plate. For maximum performance, install an acoustic door seal kit. These kits include perimeter seals, an automatic drop seal and an adjustable threshold; they’re common in studios and hotel rooms.

## Add a decorative barrier

Heavy curtains aren’t just for windows. Install a curtain rod above the door and hang a thick curtain or drape that reaches the floor. The extra layer of fabric traps noise and reduces echoes【667730347589269†L310-L317】. This solution is especially helpful for sliding doors or glass doors, which are difficult to modify. You can also mount a decorative tapestry or quilt on the wall behind the door to absorb sound.
