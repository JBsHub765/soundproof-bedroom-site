# Best Ergonomic Footrests for Comfortable Workstations

Working long hours at a desk can strain your legs and lower back if your feet dangle or rest awkwardly. Ergonomic footrests lift and support your feet, promoting proper posture and circulation. According to Stanford University’s ergonomics guide, your feet should rest flat on the floor or on a **footrest** to maintain a 90‑degree angle at your hips and knees【241537496915932†screenshot】. When your chair height prevents your feet from reaching the floor, a footrest helps you achieve this neutral posture【241537496915932†screenshot】. In this guide we’ll explain why footrests matter, what features to look for and which models offer the best comfort and adjustability.

## Key takeaways

- Footrests support proper ergonomics by keeping feet flat and hips and knees at a right angle【241537496915932†screenshot】.
- Adjustable height and angle let you customize support for different chairs and desk setups.
- Look for non‑slip surfaces, rocking or tilting mechanisms and durable materials that encourage micro‑movement.
- A good footrest can reduce leg fatigue and lower back strain during extended sitting.

## Buyer’s guide

A quality footrest should match your body and workstation. Here are the top criteria to consider:

- **Height and angle adjustability:** Choose a footrest that lets you raise or lower the platform and adjust the tilt. This adaptability allows you to maintain the 90° angle at your hips and knees recommended by ergonomists【241537496915932†screenshot】.
- **Stable, non‑slip surface:** A textured or rubberized surface prevents your feet from sliding while you shift positions.
- **Motion and flexibility:** Some footrests rock or tilt to encourage gentle movement, helping improve circulation and reduce stiffness.
- **Size and portability:** If you move between workspaces, consider a lightweight footrest that fits under different desks. For shared offices, compact designs are easier to store.

## Alternatives / FAQ

### Are footrests necessary if my chair has height adjustment?

Yes. Even if your chair can be raised, your feet might not rest comfortably on the floor. A footrest fills the gap and helps you maintain a neutral posture【241537496915932†screenshot】.

### What is the best angle for a footrest?

Aim for an angle that keeps your ankles relaxed while your knees are at about 90°. Adjustable footrests let you fine‑tune the tilt to suit your comfort.

### Can a footrest help with back pain?

Proper foot support promotes a natural spinal curve by preventing you from slouching or tucking your legs under the chair. Combined with an ergonomic chair, a footrest may reduce lower‑back strain.
