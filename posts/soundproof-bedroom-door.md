# How to Soundproof a Bedroom Door: Quick Fixes and Upgrades

A noisy hallway or living room can invade your bedroom through the door, making it difficult to unwind. Like most interior doors, bedroom doors are often hollow and poorly sealed【667730347589269†L245-L257】. Fortunately, you can significantly reduce noise without major construction. This guide focuses on bedroom‑specific solutions to help you sleep better and enjoy more privacy.

## Identify leaks and weak spots

Close the door, switch off the lights and look for light around the edges and bottom. Any gap that lets light through will also let sound through. Pay attention to the door jamb, threshold and latch side. If the door rattles when shut, the latch may need adjustment. Knowing where sound leaks occur helps you choose the right solution.

## Seal the perimeter

Use adhesive weatherstripping foam or rubber strips along the sides and top of the frame. Choose materials designed for acoustic use; they compress to form an airtight seal. Fit a door sweep or automatic drop seal along the bottom to close the gap under the door. If there’s a wide gap between the floor and the threshold, add a wooden or rubber threshold to bridge it. Apply acoustic caulk around the frame to seal any cracks【667730347589269†L265-L272】. These inexpensive steps dramatically reduce noise transfer.

## Upgrade to a solid‑core door

Hollow‑core bedroom doors are light and allow sound to pass through easily. Replacing it with a solid‑core door made of engineered wood or composite material adds mass and blocks noise. Choose a door with a smooth surface to make sealing easier and have it professionally installed to ensure a tight fit. If replacing the door isn’t feasible, you can increase the mass by attaching a sheet of mass‑loaded vinyl or medium‑density fibreboard to the back of the existing door and finishing it with decorative fabric or paint.

## Add sound‑absorbing layers

Hang a heavy curtain or quilt over the bedroom side of the door. Use a curtain rod or hooks mounted above the frame so the curtain covers the entire door and extends past the sides. Thick fabrics absorb sound and reduce echoes【667730347589269†L310-L317】. For extra absorption, install an upholstered headboard or padded wall panel on the wall adjacent to the door, which helps dampen sound reflections inside the room.

Another quick fix is to hang a soundproof blanket or moving blanket on the door. These dense blankets are designed to absorb sound and can be attached with velcro strips. When you need to open the door fully, simply fold or remove the blanket.

## Address adjacent walls and floors

Sometimes the noise you hear through the door also travels through the walls and floors. Position a wardrobe, bookcase or tall dresser against the wall near the door to add mass and block sound【667730347589269†L294-L301】. Place a thick rug or carpet runner in front of the door to absorb footsteps【667730347589269†L303-L308】.
