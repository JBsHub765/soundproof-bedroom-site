If you're tired of outside noise creeping through your windows, there are several upgrades that can dramatically reduce the problem. Even small gaps around a window frame allow a surprising amount of sound to leak through, so start by sealing them with foam or vinyl weatherstripping or acoustic caulk【710868528456763†L163-L181】. Weatherstripping kits are inexpensive and easy to install; just measure your window frame and cut the material to length. Be sure to clean the frame before applying for the best adhesion.

Upgrading to a better glazing system is the next step. Single‑pane windows provide very little insulation, while double or triple glazing adds mass and an insulating air gap. Laminated acoustic glass has a plastic interlayer that helps absorb vibrations and dampen noise【710868528456763†L163-L181】. Replacing your windows isn’t always feasible in a rental, so consider secondary glazing kits that fit inside the existing frame and create an extra barrier.

Once you’ve dealt with gaps and glazing, adding mass and absorption makes a big difference. Heavy, multi‑layered curtains or cellular blinds combine dense fabrics and air pockets to absorb and reflect sound【851419691297954†L897-L953】. Choose curtains with several layers and a thick lining; the extra weight blocks more noise and also improves thermal insulation. You can also hang mass‑loaded vinyl (MLV) curtain liners for an even greater reduction in noise; the dense vinyl material blocks sound waves and is commonly used in professional studios.
