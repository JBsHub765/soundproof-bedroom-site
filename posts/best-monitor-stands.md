# Best Monitor Stands and Arms for Ergonomic Workstations

Sitting at a desk all day can put strain on your neck and upper back if your monitor is too low or off to the side.  Occupational health experts recommend positioning your screen **directly in front of you** at about **an arm’s length away** so you don’t twist your neck and body【904916643738782†L121-L134】.  The **top of the monitor should be at or just below eye level** and you should be able to tilt or swivel the screen to avoid glare【904916643738782†L140-L154】.  A dedicated monitor stand or articulating arm lets you dial in these settings even if your desk or monitor doesn’t adjust.

## Key takeaways

- **Proper positioning matters:** Keeping your monitor directly in front of you at a comfortable viewing distance reduces neck strain and prevents you from twisting your body【904916643738782†L121-L134】.
- **Adjustable height and tilt are essential:** Stands and arms that raise your screen to eye level and allow tilt and swivel adjustments help you maintain a neutral head and neck position【904916643738782†L140-L154】.
- **Look for stability and capacity:** Choose a stand or arm with a weight rating that exceeds your monitor’s weight and a wide, stable base or clamp.
- **Extra features add value:** Integrated cable management and storage shelves keep your workspace tidy; some stands double as laptop risers to bring portable screens to the proper height【904916643738782†L172-L176】.

## Buyer’s guide

### Positioning and viewing distance

The most important factor is placing your monitor in front of you rather than off to the side.  Stanford University’s ergonomic guidelines suggest that the screen should be **positioned directly in front and facing you**, so your neck isn’t twisted, and that it should be **an arm’s length away** for most people【904916643738782†L121-L134】.  If you wear bifocals or progressive lenses, you may prefer the screen slightly lower to avoid tipping your head back【904916643738782†L140-L154】.

### Height adjustability

Many monitors lack enough height adjustment on their own.  A good stand or arm lets you raise or lower the screen so the **top of the monitor is at or just below eye level**, keeping your head and neck in a neutral position【904916643738782†L140-L146】.  Gas‑spring arms make it easy to move the display up and down, while simple risers lift the screen a few inches and can double as a storage shelf.

### Tilt, swivel and rotation

To minimise glare and accommodate your posture, the screen should **tilt and swivel easily**【904916643738782†L140-L154】.  Monitor arms often offer a full range of motion—including rotation to portrait mode—while stands may only provide limited tilt.  Consider how often you adjust your display when choosing between a fixed riser and an arm.

### Stability and weight capacity

Make sure the stand or arm can support your monitor’s size and weight.  Check the weight rating and clamp or base design.  A heavy monitor may require a dual‑clamp arm or a wide metal base.  For larger displays (27 inches and up), a robust arm or stand is essential to prevent wobble.

### Desk compatibility and installation

Desk clamps free up workspace but require a solid lip to attach.  Freestanding risers work on any surface but take up more desk real estate.  Some arms also offer through‑desk mounts if you have a grommet hole.  Choose the installation method that suits your desk.

### Bonus features

Cable management channels keep cords tidy.  Some stands incorporate drawers or shelves for storing accessories.  Laptop risers can raise a portable screen to eye level and pair with a separate keyboard and mouse【904916643738782†L172-L176】.  If you work on a laptop and a monitor, look for an arm system that supports both.

## Top picks

*For those who don’t know where to start, here are a few reliable options with strong reviews and good adjustability.*

### Flexible monitor arm

A gas‑spring arm gives you the most flexibility, allowing height, tilt, swivel and rotation adjustments.  It clamps to the back of your desk and supports monitors up to around 32 inches.  Choose an arm with a weight rating that exceeds your monitor’s weight for maximum stability.

### Simple monitor riser

A riser lifts your monitor a few inches and often includes space underneath for storing a keyboard or accessories.  It’s ideal if you only need a slight height boost and your monitor doesn’t require frequent adjustment.  Look for models with non‑slip feet and a sturdy platform.

### Dual monitor arm with laptop tray

If you use a laptop alongside an external display, consider a dual arm that holds both.  These systems typically have a tray for your laptop and an adjustable arm for the monitor, so you can align both screens at eye level and free up desk space.

## Alternatives / FAQs

**Do I really need a monitor stand or arm?**  If your monitor’s built‑in stand lets you position the screen at eye level and directly in front of you, you may not need an accessory.  However, most monitors sit too low, causing you to tilt your head downward.  A stand or arm helps you maintain neutral posture and reduce neck strain.

**What height should my monitor be?**  Ergonomic guidelines suggest the top of the screen should be at or just below eye level when you sit upright【904916643738782†L140-L146】.  Adjust the height so you don’t have to tilt your head up or down to see the screen clearly.

**Can monitor arms handle heavy monitors?**  Yes, but you need to select an arm rated for your monitor’s weight and size.  Always check the manufacturer’s specifications and choose a model with a higher weight capacity than your monitor.
