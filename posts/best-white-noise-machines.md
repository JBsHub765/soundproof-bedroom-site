## Buyer’s guide

### What is white noise?

White noise combines all audible frequencies at equal intensity.  This creates a uniform “hissing” sound that your brain quickly tunes out【50036423978782†L84-L101】.  Variants include **pink noise** and **brown noise**, which emphasise lower frequencies and offer a deeper, gentler tone【50036423978782†L120-L125】.  Some machines also include natural sounds—such as rain, ocean waves or a fan—so you can choose the ambience that’s most relaxing.

### Key features to consider

* **Adjustable volume:** Choose a machine with multiple volume levels so you can set it just loud enough to mask distractions without being overbearing【50036423978782†L134-L139】.
* **Sound options:** Variety matters.  Look for devices that include true white noise along with pink and brown noise or nature sounds.  This way you can experiment and find the most soothing tone.
* **Timer and sleep modes:** A timer allows the machine to turn off automatically after you’re asleep, saving energy.  Some devices gradually decrease volume to avoid jarring you awake.
* **Portability and power:** If you travel frequently, pick a model with a compact form factor that runs on USB or battery power.  Being able to maintain your sleep routine in a hotel or airplane makes a big difference.
* **Ease of use:** Simple controls, a backlit display and memory function (which remembers your last settings) improve usability.

### Setting up your sleep environment

For best results, use your white noise machine as part of a broader sleep strategy.  Close windows to block street noise and dim the lights an hour before bed.  Consider upgrading to **noise‑reducing curtains or acoustic panels** if external sounds are particularly intrusive.  Products like the NICETOWN blackout curtains are designed to absorb sound while blocking light; combining them with a white noise machine creates a calm sanctuary.

## Alternatives / FAQ

Here are answers to common questions about white noise machines.

### Is white noise safe to use every night?

Generally yes.  White noise machines produce sound levels well below anything that could damage hearing.  Keep the volume at a comfortable level and avoid placing the device directly next to your ears.  If you have a baby or small child, use the lowest effective volume and consult your paediatrician.

### Should I choose white, pink or brown noise?

It depends on your preference.  **White noise** is evenly balanced across frequencies and can be effective for masking high‑pitched sounds.  **Pink noise** emphasises lower frequencies and many people find it more pleasant.  **Brown noise** is deeper still.  Many machines offer all three so you can test and decide which helps you relax.

### Do I need a white noise machine if I have a fan?

A fan can provide some ambient sound, but it lacks the frequency range and adjustability of a dedicated white noise machine.  Fans also don’t offer sleep timers or portable design.  However, combining a fan with a white noise machine can work well if you enjoy airflow.

### Can white noise help with study or concentration?

Yes.  Steady ambient sound can mask conversations and other distractions, allowing you to focus more effectively.  Many people use white noise for work sessions or meditation as well as sleep.  Choose a machine with a variety of soundscapes so you can pick something soothing yet unobtrusive.
