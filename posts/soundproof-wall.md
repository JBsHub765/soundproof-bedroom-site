# How to Soundproof a Wall: Materials and Methods to Block Sound

Walls are thin barriers between you and the outside world. In many modern homes they're built from timber studs and a single layer of plasterboard, leaving a hollow cavity that resonates with sound. Conversations, music and traffic easily pass through these light structures【667730347589269†L245-L257】. This article explains how to upgrade your walls so they block more noise—whether you're renovating or looking for quick fixes.

## Why walls let noise through

Sound travels through air and solid materials. Hollow stud walls contain air cavities that amplify sound, while the thin plasterboard vibrates with incoming noise. For a wall to block sound, it needs mass, airtightness and separation. If any of these are missing, noise will leak through.

## Add mass to the wall

### Acoustic plasterboard and cement board

The simplest way to increase mass is to add another layer of dense material. Acoustic plasterboard is thicker and heavier than standard drywall and designed to absorb sound waves【254877037099467†L94-L108】. Cement board or gypsum boards are other options, but they can be heavy and require sturdy framing. Attach the new board over the existing wall using screws, staggered joints to avoid continuous seams.

### Mass‑loaded vinyl and mineral wool

Mass‑loaded vinyl (MLV) is a dense, flexible membrane that adds significant mass without adding much thickness. Staple or nail MLV to the studs before installing new plasterboard. Combine it with mineral wool insulation inside the cavity to absorb sound energy. Using a variety of materials blocks a broader spectrum of frequencies【254877037099467†L117-L126】 than simply adding more plasterboard.

### Layering strategy

For best results, build a "sandwich" wall: existing plasterboard, MLV, mineral wool between studs, resilient channel or isolation clips, then a new layer of acoustic plasterboard. This combination adds mass and separation, providing substantial noise reduction.

## Decouple the wall to stop vibrations

Sound vibrations travel through continuous structures. To stop them, decouple the new wall layers from the existing wall using resilient channels or sound‑isolation clips【254877037099467†L128-L144】. These metal rails attach to studs and hold the new plasterboard slightly away, creating a break that reduces vibration transmission. Another option is to build a separate stud frame a few centimetres away from the existing wall, effectively creating two walls with an air gap. Fill the gap with insulation and cover the new frame with plasterboard.

## Seal all gaps and penetrations

Even the most massive wall will leak sound if there are gaps. Seal seams, joints and cracks with flexible acoustic caulk【667730347589269†L265-L272】. Pay attention to outlets, light switches and pipes—sound can travel through these penetrations. Use putty pads around electrical boxes and fit acoustic gaskets behind switch plates. At the top and bottom of the wall, fill gaps between plasterboard and floors/ceilings with sealant. Test for leaks by shining a flashlight along joints; any light indicates a gap.

## Quick fixes and decorative options

If you're renting or can't build new walls, there are still ways to reduce noise:

- Hang thick blankets, quilts or wall tapestries over the wall【743105201352173†L542-L546】.
- Install bookcases filled with books along the wall【743105201352173†L515-L520】—the mass and irregular surfaces diffuse sound.
- Use removable acoustic panels or foam tiles behind artwork.
- Add a wardrobe or storage unit against the noisy wall【667730347589269†L294-L301】.

These solutions won't match the performance of a rebuilt wall but will make a noticeable difference.

## Combine methods for maximum effect

Wall soundproofing works best when you combine mass, insulation, decoupling and sealing. For major renovations, follow the layered approach with MLV, insulation and resilient channels. For smaller budgets or rental properties, focus on adding mass via bookcases and heavy décor. Pair wall improvements with other techniques like [soundproofing doors](/posts/soundproof-door) and [soundproofing floors and ceilings](/posts/soundproof-room) for whole‑room noise reduction.
