# Best Power Banks and Portable Chargers for Travel and Emergencies

{% include affiliate-note.html %}

## Key takeaways
* **Versatile portable power** – A power bank is essentially a portable battery with one or more USB ports. It can recharge smartphones, tablets and other gadgets, and larger models can even top up laptops or power small appliances【742703548423541†L170-L187】.
* **Capacity vs output** – Capacity (mAh) tells you how many charges the bank can store. However, it’s the **wattage output** that dictates how fast your devices will charge【684256763447673†L104-L108】.
* **Safety and ports matter** – Good power banks include protections against over‑charging and overheating, multiple output ports and durable casings【684256763447673†L108-L111】.
* **Travel rules** – Airlines limit batteries over 100 Wh to carry‑on luggage. High‑capacity banks should be carried at about 50 % charge and kept away from extreme temperatures【684256763447673†L112-L115】.
* **Estimate your needs** – Compare your device’s battery (e.g. ~4,000 mAh for a smartphone) to the bank’s capacity; a 10,000 mAh bank can recharge a phone two or three times, while a 40,000 mAh bank offers multiple full charges【684256763447673†L119-L124】【684256763447673†L137-L147】.

## Buyer’s guide

Choosing a power bank isn’t just about grabbing the biggest number on the box. Here are the main criteria to consider:

### Capacity and output

* **Capacity (mAh):** This tells you how much charge the battery can store. A bank rated at 10,000 mAh will provide roughly two to three full smartphone charges, whereas a 40,000 mAh unit (approximately 148 Wh) can recharge a phone many times or even give a laptop a boost【684256763447673†L119-L124】.
* **Power output (watts):** Larger numbers mean faster charging. While capacity determines how long the power lasts, it’s the wattage that decides how quickly your devices receive energy【684256763447673†L104-L108】. Look for at least 18 W output for modern smartphones and 45 W or more if you want to charge a laptop.

### Ports and compatibility

* **Number of ports:** Having two or more USB ports allows you to charge multiple devices simultaneously. Some banks include USB‑C ports that can both charge the bank and output to your devices.
* **Cable standards:** USB‑C is now the standard for most Android devices and many laptops. If you use an iPhone, ensure the bank supports Lightning (via cable) or has a USB‑C port and use a compatible cable.

### Safety features and build quality

* **Protection circuits:** Quality power banks include safeguards against over‑charging, short circuits and overheating【684256763447673†L108-L111】. Cheaper, no‑name models often skip these features.
* **Durability:** If you travel frequently, choose a bank with a sturdy shell. Some rugged models are drop‑resistant and weather‑proof.

### Portability and airline rules

* **Size and weight:** Higher capacity means a heavier device. 10,000 mAh banks are usually pocket‑sized; 20,000 mAh banks are closer to a paperback book; and 40,000 mAh units can be as heavy as a small laptop.
* **Airline regulations:** Most airlines allow power banks under 100 Wh in carry‑on luggage only. Batteries over that threshold may require special permission or cannot be flown at all【684256763447673†L112-L115】. Always pack them in your hand luggage and keep them partially charged when travelling.

### Features that make life easier

* **Pass‑through charging:** Lets you charge your devices while the power bank itself is plugged in. This is handy if you have limited wall outlets.
* **Integrated cables or wireless charging:** Some banks include built‑in cables to reduce clutter, while others support Qi wireless charging for compatible phones.
* **LED indicators:** A clear battery meter helps you see at a glance how much power remains.

### High‑capacity alternatives

If you need more juice—for instance, to charge a laptop or support multiple devices on a long trip—consider stepping up to a bank with 20,000 mAh or more. These models are heavier but offer **fast‑charging USB‑C** outputs (often up to 60 W). Remember that units over 100 Wh (≈27,000 mAh) may not be allowed on flights【684256763447673†L112-L115】. When shopping for larger banks, ensure they advertise protections against overheating and short circuits【684256763447673†L108-L111】.
