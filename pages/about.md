## Our mission
We help you make faster, better buying decisions on products that genuinely improve home, work, and travel.

## What makes us different
- **Research first:** We compare verified buyer feedback, spec sheets, and independent testing where available.
- **Real value:** Picks favour reliability, fair pricing, and easy returns.
- **Clear disclosures:** We use affiliate links (see our [Affiliate Disclosure]({{ site.baseurl }}/affiliate-disclosure/)) and mark paid links.

## How we choose products
1. Shortlist items with average ratings of 4.3 stars or higher and at least 300 reviews (flexible in niche categories).
2. Prioritise models that are in stock, with warranties and responsive support.
3. Compare key criteria (for example, noise reduction, ergonomics, battery life) and list pros and cons.

## Editorial standards
- We don't accept payment for positive coverage.
- Affiliate partnerships do not influence our recommendations.
- Corrections: if we get something wrong, we fix it quickly and note the change.

## Contact and feedback
Use our [Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) page to suggest products, corrections, or new topics.
