**Summary:** We keep things simple. We do not ask for or collect personal data on this site by default. If you click outbound links (for example, to Amazon), those sites may set cookies or collect data under their own policies.

## What we collect
- **Browsing:** We serve static pages via GitHub Pages. We do not run server-side code here.
- **Forms & emails:** If you contact us via the Contact page (e.g., GitHub Issues), your profile and any details you share become visible there.
- **Analytics (optional):** If/when we add GA4 or Plausible, we will update this page and the cookie section accordingly.

## Cookies and tracking
- **On this site:** We do not set tracking cookies by default.
- **Affiliate links:** As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. Amazon and other retailers may set cookies when you follow our links. See Amazon’s Privacy Notice for details.
- **Analytics:** We use Google Analytics 4 and Plausible to collect aggregate, anonymised statistics about visits and outbound clicks. Plausible is privacy-focused and does not use cookies; GA4 may use cookies but respects your consent settings.

## Third-party services we link to
- Amazon and other retailers (for product purchases)
- GitHub (for contacting us via Issues)
- Plausible (for analytics)
Each service has its own privacy policy, which applies when you visit them.

## Children’s privacy
This site is intended for a general audience and not directed to children under 13.

## Changes
We may update this policy as our site evolves. The latest version is always available here.
